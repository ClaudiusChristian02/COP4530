this was a difficult project for me i spent a lot of time trying to make it work without the hint methods and using 
previously created lists and queues. I finally implemented the methods provided in the document. In all it took
me about 14 hours to make it work.  Some of teh challenges was clearing the buffer, next it was diffucult trying
to get the program to work with hw1 lists. I was able to repurpose a vector.h file from a previous class.
