This directory contains executable files that should be run under the student's
account. These illustrate:

 - various technical points from the course, as referenced in lectures or
   assignments
 - example executables of completed assignments

Versions with name ending with _s are executables for Sun/Solaris for running on
one of the program machines. Versions name ending in _i are executables for
Intel/Linux for running on one of the linprog machines.

Note that these do not have execute permission in the course directory. To
execute:

1. Copy the file into your pwrsonal directory
2. Change permissions to executable (chmod 700 filename)
3. Execute by naming the file on the command line
